Most real-world applied Machine Learning (ML) classification tasks involve imbalanced data. 
Thus, addressing class imbalance is crucial for improving classifier performance.
While many existing techniques focus on data level and algorithmic level solutions,
their effectiveness in handling the skewness aspect of imbalanced data, other factors,
such as class overlapping, etc., often receive lesser attention. 
This gap often leads to underutilizing promising approaches like Cost-Sensitive Learning (CSL) algorithms, 
which have shown potential in handling class imbalance. 
We empirically review a set of CSL algorithms that use ICDR(Inverse Class Distribution ratio) based cost matrices 
and assesses their performance against cost-insensitive (CSIL) algorithms.
We consider factors such as class overlapping, minority class's sample size alongside skewness, 
diverse data domains, and ML models for a generic view of their performance. 
These experiments enhances the understanding of class imbalance by comprehensive empirical evaluation of CSL and 
CSIL algorithms for these factors. It also highlights the potential and applicability of ICDR based cost matrices for 
CSL algorithms.
