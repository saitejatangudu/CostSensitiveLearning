# Cost Sensitive Learning for Class Imbalanced Data

Welcome to the repository for my M.Tech Dissertation titled "Cost Sensitive Learning (CSL) for Class Imbalanced Data". This repository contains both the data and code used in the dissertation.

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into three main components:

1. **Impact of Cost Matrices on CSL Algorithms**
   - Folder: `Degree_of_Imbalance_and_Cost_Matrices`
   - This section explores the impact of different cost matrices on the performance of CSL algorithms. You can find the code and data related to this analysis here.

2. **Use Case Study of the De Facto Cost Matrix: Inverse Class Distribution Ratio (ICDR)**
   - Folder: `ICDR_The_Defacto_Cost_Matrix`
   - This section focuses on a specific cost matrix, the Inverse Class Distribution Ratio (ICDR), and conducts a detailed use case study. Code and data relevant to this study are provided in this folder.

3. **Proposed Method: AdaSYN Based Cost Matrix Design and Performance Comparison with Complexity Measure Based Cost Matrix Design**
   - Folder: `Complexity_Measures_Based_Cost_Matrix_Design`
   - Here, we introduce our proposed method for cost matrix design based on AdaSYN and compare its performance with complexity measure-based cost matrix design methods. Code and data for this comparison are available in this folder.

Additionally, the repository includes the following components:

- **Thesis Dissertation Document**
  - The document containing the complete thesis dissertation is provided in the root directory of the repository.

- **Datasets and Preprocessing**
  - Folder: `Datasets_and_Preprocessing`
  - This folder contains the datasets used for the experiments along with associated notebooks for data preprocessing. The directory structure within this folder organizes datasets and their respective preprocessing notebooks.
